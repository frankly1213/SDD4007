## Self-introduction

<br>My name is frankly. I am studying at the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education with a Higher Diploma in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. 


During my studies, I have learned some programming languages, including C# and Python. I have explored machine learning, reinforcement learning, and applications of AI using ROS. I also have experience with the IOT, particularly / Especially with Arduino.
 

In addition to this skills, I have studied spatial description and transformation, using matrix to calculate the movements of robot arms and Euler angles. I learned about Laplace transforms applied to signal systems with the help of MATLAB. 


Furthermore, I have experience with MySQL, I using this created a small database system for managing book loans.
